# Geodemographical-Segmentation-Churn-Modeling
Predict which customers will leave the bank

Built a robust geodemographical model to analyze churn rate of a bank <br>
Apply Cumulative Accuracy Profile (CAP) to assess model on test data <br>
Derive insights from CAP curve<br>


session.inp - record of session commands to derive new independent variables and check for collinearity<br>
session2.inp - store p_hat for CAP <br>
session3.inp - store p_hat for test data for CAP<br> 

Model 13 - logistic regression model <br>

CAP Curve for Model - Training model analysis<br>
Cap Curve for Model on Test Data - Running model on test data, analysis<br>
Churn Modelling Report - report data generated from model <br>
Insights - insights report
